          Reality is not exhausted by what exists.
        </p>

        <p>
          What is <em>actual</em>—what operates, persists, or enforces
          itself—can be false. What is <em>true</em>—what coheres,
          corresponds, and endures—can be ignored. Conflating the two is
          a category error with moral consequences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Modern life increasingly treats functionality as proof of
          truth: that which stabilizes behavior is assumed legitimate;
          that which persists is assumed justified. This is incoherent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Falsehoods can organize institutions. Lies can become
          self-fulfilling. Power can simulate reality. None of this makes
          them true.
        </p>

        <p>
          Truth is not whatever works. Truth is a constraint on what
          <em>can</em> work indefinitely.
        </p>

        <p>
          When actuality is mistaken for truth, suffering follows—not
          because reality is harsh, but because it is misdescribed.
          Individuals are asked to adapt to false premises. Institutions
          are insulated from justification. Coherence is replaced by
          compliance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meaning does not arise from preference or invention. It arises
          from intelligibility under constraint.
        </p>

        <p>
          A life, a narrative, or an institution is meaningful only
          insofar as it remains coherent across time—logically,
          morally, and causally. Stability without truth is temporary.
          Comfort without coherence is anesthetic. Endurance without
          intelligibility is impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
          This position does not require agreement. It does not seek
          consensus. It remains in force regardless of belief.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where truth is subordinated to what merely functions, collapse
          is delayed—not avoided.
        </p>

        <p>
          That boundary is non-negotiable.
