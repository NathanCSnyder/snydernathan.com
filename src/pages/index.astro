    <p>Reality is not exhausted by what exists.</p>

    <p>
      What is <em>actual</em>—what operates, persists, or enforces itself—can be
      false. What is <em>true</em>—what coheres, corresponds, and endures—can be
      ignored. Conflating the two is a category error with moral consequences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern life increasingly treats functionality as proof of truth: that which
      stabilizes behavior is assumed legitimate; that which persists is assumed
      justified. This is incoherent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Falsehoods can organize institutions. Lies can become self-fulfilling.
      Power can simulate reality. None of this makes them true.
    </p>

    <p>
      Truth is not whatever works. Truth is a constraint on what <em>can</em>
      work indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p>
      When actuality is mistaken for truth, suffering follows—not because reality
      is harsh, but because it is misdescribed. Individuals are asked to adapt to
      false premises. Institutions are insulated from justification. Coherence is
      replaced by compliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meaning does not arise from preference or invention. It arises from
      intelligibility under constraint.
    </p>

    <p>
      A life, a narrative, or an institution is meaningful only insofar as it
      remains coherent across time—logically, morally, and causally. Stability
      without truth is temporary. Comfort without coherence is anesthetic.
      Endurance without intelligibility is impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
      This position does not require agreement. It does not seek consensus. It
      remains in force regardless of belief.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where truth is subordinated to what merely functions, collapse is delayed—not
      avoided.
    </p>

    <p>That boundary is non-negotiable.</p>
