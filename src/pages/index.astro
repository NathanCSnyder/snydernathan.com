    <h1>
      I work on questions of narrative, meaning, and coherence—how stories shape
      human life, institutions, and moral imagination over long time horizons.
    </h1>

    <p>
      The writing here is concerned less with expression than with structure: how
      narratives hold, where they break, and what they make possible when they do.
      I publish slowly, revise deliberately, and favor work that remains
      intelligible even when context and fashion fall away.

    <p>
      This site is not a feed. It is a record of thinking made public only when it
      feels settled enough to stand.
