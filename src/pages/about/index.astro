      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        This site is a record of my ongoing work on questions of narrative,
        meaning, and coherence—how stories shape human life, moral reasoning, and
        institutions over long spans of time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I write slowly and revise deliberately. Most work is published only after
        it has been allowed to settle.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is personal, but it is not diaristic. It exists to host work I
        am willing to stand behind even if it circulates quietly, or not at all.
