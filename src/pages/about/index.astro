  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    This site is a record of my ongoing work on questions of narrative, meaning,
    and coherence—how stories shape human life, moral reasoning, and institutions
    over long spans of time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I write slowly and revise deliberately. Most work is published only after it
    has been allowed to settle.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is personal, but it is not diaristic. It exists to host work I am
    willing to stand behind even if it circulates quietly, or not at all.
