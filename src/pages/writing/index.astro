  <h1>Writing</h1>

  <p>
    The work collected here concerns narrative, meaning, and coherence—how stories
    shape moral reasoning, institutions, and long-term human life.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a complete archive, nor a chronological feed. Pieces are published
    when they feel capable of standing on their own.
